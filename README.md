# Freshco-Hypermarket-EXCEL
I recently conducted a comprehensive analysis of our Order Level, Customer Level, Delivery, and Completion Rate metrics using Excel. This analysis revealed key performance trends and identified areas for improvement. Based on the insights, I developed targeted strategies to streamline order processes, optimize delivery schedules, and improve on-time completion. By addressing these areas, we can reduce bottlenecks, enhance delivery accuracy and speed, and ultimately improve the customer experience. This data-driven approach aims to increase operational efficiency and strengthen customer loyalty.
